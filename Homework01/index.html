              <p>I am currently a Sr. Associate Product Manager at a leading office furniture design company. I oversee numerous projects from concept to customer. Although I am a product manager by day, I am an aspiring coder by night attending the University of Minnesota's Coding Bootcamp. My favorite part of coding and web development are the problem-solving and trouble shooting aspects.</p>
              <p>When I am not working or studying the art of coding I am hanging out with my dog, a black lab named Hank. I am also attending concerts with my husband, Ross. We like to travel around the country to see our favorite bands play while visiting a city or state we have never been to before. As a family we are in the process of renovating our house; I project manage, Ross does the manual labor, and Hank supervises.</p>
