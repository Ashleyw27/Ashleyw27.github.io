# Day Planner - Ashley Wegwerth
## Description and Usage
This day planner was created to help keep track of your daily to-do's so you never miss an important task.

Upon opening the day planner the current day will display at the very top and each time block will change color based on the hour of the day: Gray = past hour(s), red = present hour, and green = future hour(s).

Type a task into a specific time block and click the save button located at the far right of that time block. Doing this will save your task for that time. Once all of your tasks are complete, click the "Clear Schedule" button at the bottom of the day planner and you will be ready to start tomorrow with a clean slate.
