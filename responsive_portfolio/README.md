# Responsive Portfolio
## User Story
As a web developer

I want a responsive deployed portfolio

So that I can showcase my responsive applications to potential employers and clients

## Description
This responsive portfolio is a replica of my original portfolio I created, but includes a few tweaks. I utilized a bootstrap CDN link within my 'head' tag which allowed me to utilize bootstrap's built-in responsiveness as well as incorporate bootstrap components within my code. Some of these components include a navbar and a contact form.
