# Password Generator - Ashley Wegwerth
## Description and Usage
This tool was built to generate a password based on the users preferences including password length and the types of characters that the user would like included in the password (symbols, numbers, lower case letters, and/or upper case letters). To run the program the user will press the *Generate Password* button and a prompt will appear on the page asking the user to specify the desired length of their password. The user must choose between 8 and 128 characters if they choose outside of those parameters they will receive an alert asking them to choose again. 

Once a password length is chosen the user will be asked to confirm the types of characters their password should include. If the user clicks *OK* that character will appear in their password. If the user clicks *Cancel* that character will not appear in their password. 

After all the parameters are chosen a randomized password will appear on the screen for the user to utilize.
