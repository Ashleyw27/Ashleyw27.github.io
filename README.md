## Description and Usage
I am a Full Stack Web Developer with experience in Product and Project Management. I have a bachelorâ€™s degree from the University of Wisconsin-Stout and a certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of Minnesota. I bring with me excellent time management skills, strong attention to detail and the ability to collaborate cross-functionally.

This repo houses the majority of my development projects from the very beginning of my coding career all the way to more advanced projects as I continued to master more skills and languages.
