# Responsive Portfolio - Ashley Wegwerth
## Description
This responsive portfolio is a replica of my original portfolio I created, but includes a few tweaks. I utilized a bootstrap CDN link within my 'head' tag which allowed me to utilize bootstrap's built-in responsiveness as well as incorporate bootstrap components within my code. Some of these components include a navbar and a contact form.

## Usage
The site was built to be user-friendly, easy to navigate, and responsive. Each section can be accessed by clicking the links in the navigation bar located on the top left of each page.

## Technology
Twitter Bootstrap

## What I Learned
I learned many new concepts and skills creating this responsive portfolio. A few of which include:
* The benefits of bootstrap
* How and where to add a bootstrap CDN link
* How to incorporate bootstrap components
* How to manipulate the pre-defined CSS that comes along with bootstrap
* How to use devtools to inspect my code
